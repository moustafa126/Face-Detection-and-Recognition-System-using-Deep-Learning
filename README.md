# Face-Detection-and-Recognition-System-using-Deep-Learning
•Implemented a face detection and recognition system using deep learning techniques.
•Utilized a pre-trained model called nn4.small2.v1.h5 for face recognition.
•Implemented the following steps: face detection, face alignment, feature extraction, face recognition, and
face clustering.
